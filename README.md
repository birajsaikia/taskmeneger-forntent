Explanation of Design Choices and Assumptions
JWT Authentication:

To ensure secure user sessions, JWT tokens are used to authenticate requests after login. This token is stored in cookies for easy management.
Task Management:

Tasks are designed to be user-specific. Each user can create, edit, and delete their own tasks, which are stored in the database with a reference to the userid.
MongoDB:

MongoDB was chosen as the database for its flexibility and scalability in handling JSON-like documents, making it a great fit for this application.
Material-UI:

The Material-UI library was chosen for UI components, offering a consistent and responsive design out-of-the-box.
State Management:

React's useState hook is used to manage form data and application states like error messages and task lists.
Additional Features Implemented
Search Bar: Allows users to filter tasks by title or description, making it easier to find specific tasks.
Task Pagination: Limits the number of tasks displayed at once and implements pagination, improving performance and user experience.
Responsive Design: The application is responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
